# SUD Features

Some new features were introduced in the SUD framework.
Even if the feature `ExtPos` is also now used by [some UD treebanks](https://tables.grew.fr/?data=ud_feats/FEATS&cols=ExtPos), we consider it here as a *SUD feature*.

Tree SUD specific features are used:
 - [`ExtPos`](ExtPos) for external POS in idioms or tilte
 - [`Shared`](Shared) for encoding the fact that dependants are shored or not in coordination constructions
 - [`Subject`](Subject) for control verbs
