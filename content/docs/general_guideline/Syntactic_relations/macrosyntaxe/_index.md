# Macrosyntactic relations


In this part we will present the relations used to analyse relations beyond the microsyntactic analysis between a governor and its dependant.
We call this type of analysis _macrosyntax_.

This approach can be used to analyse two elements that are placed side by side with no explicit marker of coordination, subordination or argument relation with the head word.
Ex: *I told him don't do it.* in this sentence we miss the usual marker *that*. Or in the following sentence: *My brother's children, you know he has two daughters, will come to visit* the part *you know he has two daughters* is inserted in the main sentence.

This phenomenon is frequent in languages and especially in oral speech. We gather these cases under the [`parataxis`](./parataxis) relation.

Some extensions are defined:

- [`parataxis:parenth`](./parataxis/parataxis_parenth) for parenthetical clauses (that can form independent sentences)
- [`parataxis:insert`](./parataxis//parataxis_insert) for inserted clauses (that cannot form an independent sentence)


However, there are three other cases that are not gathered under the `parataxis` relationship.
The following three relations link elements to the main proposition on a macrosyntactic level.
In some cases, these elements can be propositions, but also simple elements.

 - [`dislocated`](./dislocated/dislocated)
 - [`vocative`](./vocative/vocative)
 - [`discourse`](./discourse/discourse)


 __Note__:

The extended relation [`parataxis:obj`](./parataxis/parataxis_obj) were used before for attaching direct discourse.
It is now deprecated,
