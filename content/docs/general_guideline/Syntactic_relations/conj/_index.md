# `conj` and extensions

In UD there are three relations :

[`reparandum`](https://universaldependencies.org/u/dep/reparandum.html),

[`conj`](https://universaldependencies.org/u/dep/conj.html),

[`appos`](https://universaldependencies.org/u/dep/appos.html)

that SUD only uses for analysing written texts.

These three relations work as paradigmatic lists. That's why in SUD for oral speech, we decided to gather these three relations under the relation `conj` to underline the similarity between the three.
