# Dative Shift

According to Liu (2066), mandarin has 3 possible dative construction, and not any verbs can be used in all of them. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dative_shift#Mandarin)


## Remarks
At the moment, we have a group of words which we annotes as ADP that looks like these dative construcition (给 / 不如 / 让 /(比？)). It seems that it could also be seen as a dative verb construction with a VERB and two complements.
