# Sentence Final Particle (discourse:sp)
Like in Chinese UD, we use the discourse:sp relation to annotate sentence final particle.

Citation of Leung 2016 :

Similar to classifiers, sentence-final particles are an areal feature across many East and Southeast Asian languages. They occur at the end of a sentence or utterance (8), and may have a wide variety of nonreferential meanings and functions that modify the entire sentence, including modality, speech register, “speaker/hearer orientation”, and other discourse and pragmatic uses. In Mandarin, these particles include 嗎 ma (interrogative), 了 le (new situation), 吧 ba (command/suggestion), 的 de (certainty), among others. They are integrated into the sentence they attach to as part of its prosodic contour with no pause in between.
