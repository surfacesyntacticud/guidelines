# AUX in mandarin

We follow the same convention than [Mandarin UD for AUX](https://universaldependencies.org/zh/pos/AUX_.html) except that 
- the three aspect markers 过 着 了 are annotated as particle (`PART`) instead of auxiliaries. 
- 肯 / kěn “be willing to”, 敢 / gǎn “dare” are NOT annotated as auxiliaries (as they can be modified by the aspect marker 过) and we don't think they have a specific syntactic function in the sentence.
